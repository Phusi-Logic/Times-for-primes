# Times-for-primes
A simple Python function to give an idea of how long it takes to find prime numbers depending on their size
Just a bit of code to start a repository whilst I figure out GitHub. Definitely suitable for beginners. There are faster ways to find prime numbers, but this serves to make the point that the larger the numbers, the longer it takes to find out if they're prime or not.
You could use this to explain where the computational security for RSA comes from.
