# PSEUDO CODE

# 1. Start with 'big number'
# 2. Need list of prime numbers
# 3. Try dividing 'big number' by each prime number, one by one. 
# 4. If this results in an integer, then prime number i is a factor of 'big number' --> Add prime number i to a list of prime factors. Call the integer 'smaller number'
# 5. If 'smaller number' is prime (is in the list of primes/can otherwise be identified as prime) then add to list of prime factors. Prime factorisation is complete.
# 6. Else, repeat step 3 for 'smaller number'
